# Automated Ship and Vessel Scheduling System

Genetic Algorithm based  Port Management System - for an efficient monitoring and management of Port Traffic. There are two modules of the project i.e., 1. Scheduling of In-bound and Out-bound ships and 2. Dynamic planning for down-loading and uploading of freight. We have different types of ships/vessels, different arrival times, 
and departure times.
